A collection of interactive 3D mathematical and scientific visualizations.

## Visualizations

**Black Hole** (`black-hole.html`) - Interactive black hole simulation with gravitational lensing effects and animated accretion disk.

**Mandelbulb Fractal** (`mandelbulb-fractal.html`) - 3D fractal renderer using ray marching. Click to morph between different iterations.

**Morphing Particles** (`metamorphosis.html`) - Particle system that morphs between mathematical patterns like torus knots and attractors.

## Usage

Open any HTML file in a modern web browser. No installation required.

**Controls:**
- Drag to rotate view
- Scroll to zoom
- Click for interactions (varies by visualization)

## Requirements

- WebGL2 compatible browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
